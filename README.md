# SBSApp

The SBSApp was designed to allow a driver to send their current location to a fleet coordinator or in this case to a database team.

It was designed using MapKit, CoreLocation, Custom Table View Cells and a major use of Delegates.  

The problem this app is resolving works on two ends.   Customers generally call technical support to request a speed change on a road and need to explain and wait until a change is submitted.   
With the App, the customer will simply press a button to obtain their location and send this information to the destination set in the app or allow to send to any address.   This creates a better customer experience and lets the company taking the calls focus on more important issues.

The app also only uses GPS while it is being used to conserve battery life.  

Below are actual screenshots for the app:
