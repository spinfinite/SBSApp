# SBSApp

The SBSApp was designed to allow a driver to send their current location to a fleet coordinator or in this case to a database team.

It was designed using MapKit, CoreLocation, Custom Table View Cells and a major use of Delegates.  

The problem this app is resolving works on two ends.   Customers generally call technical support to request a speed change on a road and need to explain and wait until a change is submitted.   
With the App, the customer will simply press a button to obtain their location and send this information to the destination set in the app or allow to send to any address.   This creates a better customer experience and lets the company taking the calls focus on more important issues.

The app also only uses GPS while it is being used to conserve battery life.
